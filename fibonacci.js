//Fibonacci

/*RULES:
  The fibonacci is a special sequence of numbers
    1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34
    The first two numbers are 1 & 1, and every number after that is the sum of the previous two numbers
  This is a good time to use recursion
  Function will take in a parameter named position
    The position will indicate which number from the Fibonacci sequence to return

  Hints:
    Doesn't require a lot of code
      Don't overcomplicate
    Base case deals with the fact that the first two numbers are always 1 & 1
*/

/*PSEUDOCODE
  1) Figure out base case
    1a) If position == 1 || 2, return 1
  2) Otherwise, loop through the number of times indicated via position
