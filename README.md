I completed the "Learning Algorithms in JavaScript from Scratch" course on Udemy!  Here are all of my algorithms.

This course helped me get a thorough understanding of Big O Runtime Complexity, and gave me good algorithm practice.

Here's the course [link](https://www.udemy.com/learning-algorithms-in-javascript-from-scratch/learn/v4/overview).  I did enjoy it and found it useful so if you're looking to get some algorithm practice in JavaScript, I'd definitely recommend this course!
